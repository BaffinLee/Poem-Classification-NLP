# Poem-Classification-NLP

## Topic And Goal

The task is to classify poems into one of four genres: Affection, Environment, Music, and Death using an NLP method. This involves understanding and processing the text of poems to identify patterns and features that distinguish each genre.

I will use RNN models like LSTM and GRU to do this classification task.
